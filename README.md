The S01ar Sys virtual assistant is a web application designed for productivity and helping you with everyday tasks like password managing, currency conversion, note taking, measurement conversion, copy and pasting and translation.

## Features

- Password Manager
- Live Currency Conversion
- Note Pad
- Measurement Conversion
- Clip Board
- Translation (may not me accurate)

None of these features save changes, therefore are not fit to use as a replacement for other applications.
